# 🕷️ Spider Squash Chrome Extension 🕷️

Do you have what it takes to save your browser from a spider invasion? 🧹  
Welcome to **Spider Squash**, the ultimate Chrome extension where your quick reflexes are put to the test! Squash those spiders before they take over your screen and crawl their way into your nightmares (or at least your browser tabs 🕸️)!

## 🎮 Gameplay:
Spiders randomly appear while you browse the web. Your mission? **SQUASH THEM!**  
Click to squash, and rack up your score with each successful hit. The faster you squash, the more you score! But beware—those eight-legged creepy-crawlies aren’t sticking around forever.

### Features:
- 🕷 **Random Spider Spawns**: You never know when or where they’ll appear!
- 👆 **Squash Action**: Click the spiders to make them disappear (with a *splat*!).
- 🎯 **Score Tracker**: Keep track of how many spiders you’ve squashed.
- ⏲️ **Level Up**: The longer you play, the more frequent (and sneaky!) the spiders get.

## 📥 Installation:

1. **Clone the repo**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spider-squash-chrome-extension.git
   ```
   
2. **Open Chrome Extensions**:  
   Open a new tab and go to `chrome://extensions/` (or click the three-dot menu, hover over "More Tools," and select "Extensions").

3. **Enable Developer Mode**:  
   In the top-right corner of the Extensions page, toggle on "Developer mode."

4. **Load Unpacked Extension**:  
   Click "Load unpacked" and select the `spider-squash-chrome-extension` folder you just cloned.

5. **Start Squashing Spiders**:  
   Congratulations! Now the spiders will randomly appear as you browse. Don't let them get away!

## 🕹️ How to Play:

1. 🕷️ **Squash spiders** by clicking on them before they disappear.
2. 🏆 **Track your score** through the extension’s popup by clicking the Spider Squash icon.
3. 💯 **Challenge yourself** as spiders appear faster the longer you play. Can you become the ultimate Spider Squasher?

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **HTML** and **CSS**: Keeping it simple and stylish.
- **JavaScript**: The brains behind those sneaky spider appearances.
- **Chrome API**: Making your squashing experience interactive and responsive.

## 🎨 Assets:
- **Spiders**: Because what's a spider-squashing game without some creepy, crawly friends? (Or enemies, depending on how you feel about spiders.)
- **Squash Icon**: Tap into your inner bug exterminator!

## 🔧 Developer Notes:
- The spiders only appear randomly while you're browsing. Keep an eye out 👀!
- Your score will be stored locally, so you can keep squashing without losing your streak.
- The extension is lightweight and doesn't slow down your browsing experience—only your reflexes!

## 🚀 Future Updates:
- More spider types (yes, even faster and trickier ones!).
- Special squashing effects and sounds for a more *immersive* experience.
- Leaderboard support (compete with fellow spider squashers globally!).

## 🕸️ Contribute:
Feel free to fork this repo and add your own spooky spin to the game. Whether it's new features, UI improvements, or even your favorite sound effects when you squash a spider, we welcome all contributions! 🧑‍💻

## 🐛 Bugs? (Other than the spiders…)
